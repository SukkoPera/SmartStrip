SmartStrip
==========

SmartStrip is a sketch for Arduino meant to allow advanced control of relays
through a web interface.

While there are already similar sketches out there, SmartStrip will have many
unique features when it is complete, too many to mention now :).

At the moment the only targeted platform is KMTronic's DINo:
http://sigma-shop.com/product/72/web-internet-ethernet-controlled-relay-board-arduino-compatible-rs485-usb.html.

The DINo uses the ENC28J60 Ethernet Controller. SmartStrip supports it through
the EtherCard library, so you will need it to compile the sketch. Get it at
https://github.com/jcw/ethercard/.

I chose this board since it has everything I need for my purposes, so it is the
only platform which should work "out of the box". Other boards/configurations
can probably be supported with minor changes in the code, as long as they use
the ENC28J60. Support for the WIZ5100 controller will hopefully come in the
future, probably when the sketch will outgrow the limits of the ATmega328 and I
will need to move the development to my Mega 2560, since I use it with a
WIZ5100-based Ethernet shield ;).

The webserver component is designed to allow reuse in other projects. Hopefully
documentation for that will come in the future, but it should be quite easy to
do, if you look at the smartstrip.ino file.
