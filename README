SmartStrip
==========
SmartStrip is a sketch for Arduino meant to allow advanced control of relays
through a web interface.

While there are already similar sketches out there, SmartStrip will have many
unique features when it is complete, too many to mention now :).

At the moment the main targeted platform is KMTronic's DINo:
http://sigma-shop.com/product/72/web-internet-ethernet-controlled-relay-board-arduino-compatible-rs485-usb.html.
I chose this board since it has everything I need for my purposes, so it is the
only platform which should work "out of the box". Other boards/configurations
can probably be supported with minor changes in the code. As SmartStrip uses
the Webbino library for its webserver part, it is both compatible with the
official Ethernet Shield and ENC28J60-based shields. Unfortunately when W5100
support is enabled the resulting binary is too big to fit an Atmega328, so you
will either need to use an Arduino Mega or disable some features. Features can
be enabled and disabled in the "common.h" file. The used I/O pins can also be
changed there.

As mentioned, SmartStrip uses the Webbino libraries, and actually depends upon
other libraries that are part of my Sukkino collection, so you will need to
install it if you want to compile this sketch. It is available at:
